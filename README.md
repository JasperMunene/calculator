# Simple Calculator

A basic command-line calculator program in Python that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Addition (`+`): Add two numbers.
- Subtraction (`-`): Subtract the second number from the first.
- Multiplication (`*`): Multiply two numbers.
- Division (`/`): Divide the first number by the second. (Includes error handling for division by zero)

## How to Use

1. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python simple_calculator.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose an operation and enter two numbers for calculation.

3. The program will display the result of the operation.

## Example

```plaintext
Simple Calculator
Operations:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)

Enter the operation number (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```

## Error Handling

- If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program will display an error message.

## Further Improvements

- Add more mathematical operations.
- Implement a loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting the program.
- Improve the user interface for better user experience.
